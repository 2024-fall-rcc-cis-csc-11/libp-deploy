# libPuhfessorP - Deploy Repo

This repo should (hopefully) always contain the latest version of the libPuhfessorP shared object,
to be linked with your programs.

All generated artifacts should be in a folder named `generated`.
You can safely ignore anything in this repo, but that directory.

Check the [info.txt](info.txt) file to see details on the currently deployed version, like when it was last built.

The latest API documentation is in the [FUNCTIONS.md](FUNCTIONS.md) file.
